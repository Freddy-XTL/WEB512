            <h2>Getting to know me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi, I'm Kgomotso Freddy Mogashoa—an aspiring software developer with a passion for turning creative ideas into functional
                    digital experiences. My journey into tech began with a strong foundation in Computer Application Technology, and I'm currently
                    honing my skills in Software Development at CTU. I thrive on hands-on experimentation, collaborative troubleshooting, and
                    understanding the “why” behind every line of code. Whether it's refining responsive layouts, exploring accessibility practices,
                    or building immersive user interfaces, I approach each challenge with curiosity and resilience.
                    A fun fact about me: I’ve been gaming since I was a kid, and it’s what sparked my interest in technology. I was always fascinated
                    by how games worked behind the scenes—how characters moved, how worlds were built, and how interactions felt so seamless.
                    That curiosity led me to explore game modding, tweaking configurations, and eventually diving into web development. Gaming taught
                    me to think critically, solve problems creatively, and never give up when things get tough—skills that now fuel my passion for coding.
                    This e-portfolio is more than just a showcase—it's a reflection of my growth, my values, and my commitment to building inclusive,
                    user-centered solutions. From my services to my contact page, everything here is crafted with intention and a desire to connect.
                    If you're here to explore, collaborate, or just get to know me better, welcome to my world—I’m excited to share it with you.
