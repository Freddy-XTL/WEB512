If you want to view a website from the options in this repository then you have to clone this repository into your local device. Here are the steps to view my different website operations.

1. After cloning go to your file explorer where you placed the folder

2. Go into one of the folders of your choosing

3. Go into your file path and type cmd

4. After opening command prompt, type code .

5. When in your Visual Studio Code, open one of the html files and open with your live server.

This only works with one folder and not all of them at once! If you want to view in a different website from another folder then you have to do the exact same steps just in that folder you desire.

Enjoy viewing!
